# Why this code is here

Ever Since I was fired from AYS by Will#0929, I posted Liam's code here. The license attached with the code I give him states clearly that he is not authorised to use the code without [IngeniousApplications (IA)](http://ingeniousapps.tk)'s approval.

However, he refuses to listen, and is attempting to get IngeniousApplications into Legal Matters.

As such, IngeniousApplications will be posting the code here for Liam 2.0, and reporting Copyright.
